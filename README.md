# qiskit-qrack-provider

This repository contains a Qrack provider for Qiskit. You must [install PyQrack](https://pypi.org/project/pyqrack/) to use it.

The underlying Qrack simulator is a high-performance, GPU-accelarated, noiseless simulator, by design. This repository provides the Qrack `QasmSimulator`.

This provider is based on and adapted from work by the IBM Qiskit Team and QCGPU's creator, Adam Kelly. Attribution is noted in content files, where appropriate. Original contributions and adaptations were made by Daniel Strano of the Qrack/VM6502Q Team.
